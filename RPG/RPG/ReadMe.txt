Welcome to michael's RPG!!!! Allow me to explain some things, Read the text to understand whats going on and follow the corresponding keys to the actions you want to make.
This is simply a "beat 'em up until you die" kind of game, currently. each race you take has its benefits and downfalls as i will explain below. With that, each class has 
specific modifiers to their higher up attacks (2 and 3). My special class (vampire) has the trade out of lower dmg but you can heal off of hits from your higher attacks.
